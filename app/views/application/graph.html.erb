    <h4> Over the course of our internship we've focused on a project called "CPS Awareness".
    The purpose is to raise awareness about the flaws in CPS and bring those to ThoughWorkers and the community to find a solution to help CPS.
    As displayed, we have found a relationship between two main factors, parent involvement and safety score.
    Parent Involvement is a combination of commitment and active participation on the part of the parent to the school and the
    student. Safety score is measured by students response to the "5 Essentials Survey" that they took along with parents for parent
    involvement.
